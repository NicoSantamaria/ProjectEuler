# ProjectEuler

https://projecteuler.net

This repository is dedicated to my solutions to the Project Euler challenges. All solutions in the "Solutions" folder have a runtime of less than two seconds.
Solutions in the "Unfinished" have a runtime of less than one minute and need to be optimized further.

All solutions are written in Python.
