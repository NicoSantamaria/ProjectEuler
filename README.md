# ProjectEuler

https://projecteuler.net
This repository is dedicated to my solutions to the Project Euler challenges. 

All files in the "SolutionsPython" folder are written in Python and have been solved with a runtime of less than two seconds.

All files in the "SolutionsR" folder are written in R and are solved.

Files in the "Unfinished" folder are written in Python or R and are either unsolved or have a runtime greater than 
two seconds, and need to be optimized further.
