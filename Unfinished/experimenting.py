# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

NOTES:
I'm double checking amicable numbers. When this algorithm finds
220 and its corresponding amicable number, 284, it adds 220 and continues
iterating upward until it also adds 284. The algorithm could be optimized
by adding 220 and 284 in one go, since the is_amicable function is by far
the most expensive part of the program.
